Please see http://thekerrlab.com/asd for more information on this algorithm.

Note: while the Python and MATLAB versions of the algorithm are similar, the Python version is the most up-to-date and is the only one being currently maintained (which is why the MATLAB version uses the earlier name of "Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent).
